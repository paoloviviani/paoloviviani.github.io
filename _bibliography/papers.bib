The system will rely on advanced, distributed orchestration solutions (Atos YSTIA Suite, with Alien4Cloud and Yorc, based on TOSCA), the High-End Application Execution Middleware HEAppE, and new hardware capabilities for maximising efficiency in data processing, analysis and transfer (e.g. Burst Buffers with GPU- and FPGA-based data reprocessing). LEXIS handles computation tasks and data from three Pilots, based on representative and demanding HPC/Cloud-Computing use cases in Industry (SMEs) and Science: i) Simulations of complex turbomachinery and gearbox systems in Aeronautics, ii) Tsunami simulations and earthquake loss assessments which are time-constrained to enable immediate warnings and to support well-informed decisions, and iii) Weather and Climate simulations where massive amounts of in-situ data are assimilated to improve forecasts. A user-friendly LEXIS web portal, as a unique entry point, will provide access to data as well as workflow-handling and remote visualisation functionality. As part of its back-end, LEXIS builds an elaborate system for the handling of input, intermediate and result data. At its core, a Distributed Data Infrastructure (DDI) ensures the availability of LEXIS data at all participating HPC sites, which will be federated with a common LEXIS Authentication and Authorisation Infrastructure (with unified security model, user database and policies). The DDI leverages best of breed data-management solutions from EUDAT, such as B2SAFE (based on iRODS) and B2HANDLE. REST APIs on top of it will ensure a smooth interaction with LEXIS workflows and the orchestration layer. Last, but not least, the DDI will provide functionalities for Research Data Management following the FAIR principles (“Findable, Interoperable, Accessible, Reusable”), e.g. DOI acquisition, which helps to publish and disseminate open data products.}

Moreover, they can potentially scale up to hundreds of quantum bits (qubits). In this work, we solve a Graph Coloring problem by iteratively computing the solutions of Maximal Independent Set (MIS) problems, exploiting the Rydberg blockade phenomenon. Experimental results using a simulation framework on the CINECA Marconi-100 supercomputer demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach.},

In each optimization step of the so-called multi-disciplinary optimization (MDO) process, sensitive data is exchanged between organizations, and we require auditability and traceability of actions taken to assure compliance with signed legal agreements.In this paper, we present a distributed protocol that coordinates authenticated and auditable exchanges of files, leveraging a smart contract. The entire life cycle of a file exchange, including file registration, access request and key distribution, is recorded and traceable via the smart contract. Moreover, when one party raises a dispute, the smart contract can be used to identify the dishonest party without compromising the file's confidentiality.The proposed protocol provides a simple, novel, yet efficient approach to exchange files with support for data access auditability between companies involved in a private consortium with no incentive to share files outside of the protocol. We implemented the protocol in Solidity, deployed it on a private Ethereum blockchain, and validated it within the use case of a decentralized workflow.},

  abstract     = {As deep learning techniques become more and more popular, there is the need to move these applications from the data scientist’s Jupyter notebook to efficient and reliable enterprise solutions. Moreover, distributed training of deep learning models will happen more and more outside the well-known borders of cloud and HPC infrastructure and will move to edge and mobile platforms. Current techniques for distributed deep learning have drawbacks in both these scenarios, limiting their long-term applicability. After a critical review of the established techniques for Data Parallel training from both a distributed computing and deep learning perspective, a novel approach based on nearest-neighbour communications is presented in order to overcome some of the issues related to mainstream approaches, such as global communication patterns. Moreover, in order to validate the proposed strategy, the Flexible Asynchronous Scalable Training (FAST) framework is introduced, which allows to apply the nearest-neighbours communications approach to a deep learning framework of choice. Finally, a relevant use-case is deployed on a medium-scale infrastructure to demonstrate both the framework and the methodology presented. Training convergence and scalability results are presented and discussed in comparison to a baseline defined by using state-of-the-art distributed training tools provided by a well-known deep learning framework.},

  abstract     = {Many applications by design depend on costly trusted third-party auditors. One such example is the industrial application case of federated multi-disciplinary optimization (MDO), in which different organizations contribute to a complex engineering design effort. Although blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT) has strong potential in reducing the dependence on such intermediaries, the architectural complexity involved in designing a solution is daunting. In this paper, we analyze the architectural variants for decentralized private data sharing while guaranteeing auditability in terms of data access operations. Non-repudiation of actions taken by each party is a key requirement, as is availability of the shared data. % through storage governed by the chain. The architectural variants analyzed focus on attaining:~(i)~confidential data exchange, (ii)~maintaining and governing access to the shared data, (iii)~providing data access auditability, (iv)~data validation or conflict resolution, and to a lesser degree (v)~transaction and identity privacy. We systematically enumerate architectural decisions at the levels of:~storage, policy-based file access control, data encryption methods, and auditability mechanisms for private data. This analysis is based on extensive assessment of the state of the art on decentralized private data access management using static or dynamic policies, and private data validation without exposing confidential information. The main contribution of this work is a comprehensive overview of architectural variants for decentralized control of private, encrypted data, and the involved trade-offs in terms of performance, auditable trust and security. These findings are validated in the context on the aforementioned industry case that involves federated multi-disciplinary optimization (MDO).},

In the emerging area of spectral graph analysis, the computing often consists in a wavefront running over a tiled matrix, involving expensive linear algebra kernels. While these applications might benefit from parallel heterogeneous platforms (multi-core with GPUs),programming wavefront applications directly with high-performance linear algebra libraries yields code that is complex to write and optimize for the specific application. We advocate a methodology based on two abstractions (linear algebra and parallel pattern-based run-time), that allows to develop portable, self-configuring, and easy-to-profile code on hybrid platforms.},

In particular, response surface models (RSM) are a key tool to reduce the computational effort involved in engineering design processes like design optimization. However, RSMs may prove to be too expensive to be computed when the dimensionality of the system and/or the size of the dataset to be synthesized is significantly high or when a large number of different response surfaces has to be calculated in order to improve the overall accuracy (e.g. like when using ensemble modelling techniques). On the other hand, the potential of modern hybrid hardware (e.g. multicore, GPUs) is not exploited by current engineering tools, while they can lead to a significant performance improvement. To fill this gap, a software framework is being developed that enables the hybrid and scalable acceleration of the linear algebra core for engineering applications and especially of RSMs calculations with a user-friendly syntax that allows good portability between different hardware architectures, with no need of specific expertise in parallel programming and accelerator technology. The effectiveness of this framework is shown by comparing an accelerated code to a single-core calculation of a radial basis function RSM on some benchmark datasets. This approach is then validated within a real-life engineering application and the achievements are presented and discussed.},

  abstract = {The Armadillo C++ library provides programmers with a high-level Matlab-like syntax for linear algebra. Its design aims at providing a good balance between speed and ease of use. It can be linked with different back-ends, i.e. different LAPACK-compliant libraries. In this work we present a novel run-time support of Armadillo, which gracefully extends mainstream implementation to enable back-end switching without recompilation and multiple back-end support. The extension is specifically designed to not affect Armadillo class template prototypes, thus to be easily interoperable with future evolutions of the Armadillo library itself. The proposed software stack is then tested for functionality and performance against a kernel code extracted from an industrial application.},

  abstract     = {Modern experimental achievements, with LHC results as a prominent but not exclusive representative, have undisclosed a new range of challenges concerning theoretical com- putations. Tree level QED calculation are no more satisfactory due to the very small experimental uncertainty of precision e+ e- measurements, so Next To Leading and Next to Next to Leading Order calculations are required. At the same time many-legs, high-order QCD processes needed to simulate LHC events are raising even more the bar of computational complexity. The drive for the present work has been the interest in calculating high multiplicity Higgs boson processes with a dedicated software library (RECOLA) currently under development at the University of Torino, as well as the related technological challenges. This thesis undertakes the task of exploring the possibilities offered by present and upcoming computing technologies in order to face these challenges properly. The first two chapters outlines the theoretical context and the available technologies. In chapter 3 a a case study is examined in full detail, in order to explore the suitability of different parallel computing solutions. In the chapter 4, some of those solutions are implemented in the context of the RECOLA library, allowing it to handle processes at a previously unexplored scale of complexity. Alongside, the potential of new, cost-effective parallel architectures is tested.},
