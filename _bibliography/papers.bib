  abstract = {In High-Performance Computing (HPC), workflows are utilized to define and manage a set of interdependent computations which allow the users to extract insights from (scientific) numerical simulations or data analytics. HPC platforms can perform extreme-scale simulations, combining Artificial Intelligence (AI) training and inference and data analytics (we refer to heterogeneous workflows), by providing tools and computing resources which serve a variety of use-cases spanning very diverse application domains (e.g., weather forecasting, quantum mechanics, etc.). Executing such workflows at scale requires to handle dependencies, job submission automation, I/O mechanisms. Despite State-of-the-Art batch schedulers can be configured and integrated with tools accomplishing this automation, a number of cases where resource allocation can lead to inefficiencies still exist. In this paper, to overcome these limitations, we present the WARP (Workflow-aware Advanced Resource Planner), a tool that integrates with workflow management tools and batch schedulers, to reserve in advance resources for an optimal execution of jobs, based on their duration, dependencies and machine load. WARP has been designed to minimize the overall workflow execution, without violating the priority policies for cluster users imposed by the system administrators.},

  abstract = {Among the limitations of current quantum machines, the qubits count represents one of the most critical challenges for porting reasonably large computational problems, such as those coming from real-world applications, to the scale of the quantum hardware. In this regard, one possibility is to decompose the problems at hand and exploit parallelism over multiple size-limited quantum resources. To this purpose, we designed a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, i.e., BBQ-mIS, to solve graph coloring problems on Rydberg atoms quantum machines. The BBQ-mIS algorithm combines the natural representation of Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problems onto the machine Hamiltonian with a Branch&Bound (BB) approach to identify a proper graph coloring. In the proposed solution, the graph representation emerges from qubit interactions (qubits represent vertexes of the graph), and the coloring is then retrieved by iteratively assigning one color to a maximal set of independent vertexes of the graph, still minimizing the number of colors with the Branch&Bound approach. We emulated real quantum hardware onto an IBM Power9-based cluster, with 32 cores/node and 256 GB/node, and exploited an MPI-enhanced library to implement the parallelism for the BBQ-mIS algorithm. Considering this use case, we also identify some technical requirements and challenges for an effective HPC-QC integration. The results show that our problem decomposition is effective in terms of graph coloring solutions quality, and provide a reference for applying this methodology to other quantum technologies or applications.},

  abstract = {Quantum machines are among the most promising technologies expected to provide significant improvements in the following years. However, bridging the gap between real-world applications and their implementation on quantum hardware is still a complicated task. One of the main challenges is to represent through qubits (i.e., the basic units of quantum information) the problems of interest. According to the specific technology under-lying the quantum machine, it is necessary to implement a proper representation strategy, generally referred to as embedding. This paper introduces a neural-enhanced optimization framework to solve the constrained unit disk problem, which arises in the context of qubits positioning for neutral atoms-based quantum hardware. The proposed approach involves a modified autoencoder model, i.e., the Distances Encoder Network, and a custom loss, i.e., the Embedding Loss Function, respectively, to compute Euclidean distances and model the optimization constraints. The core idea behind this design relies on the capability of neural networks to approximate non-linear transformations to make the Distances Encoder Network learn the spatial transformation that maps initial non-feasible solutions of the constrained unit disk problem into feasible ones. The proposed approach outperforms classical solvers, given fixed comparable computation times, and paves the way to address other optimization problems through a similar strategy.},

HPC is a broad domain targeting to provide both software and hardware solutions as well as envisioning methodologies that allow achieving goals of interest, such as system performance and energy efficiency. In this context, supercomputers have been the vehicle for developing and testing the most advanced technologies since their first appearance. Unlike cloud computing resources that are provided to the end-users in an on-demand fashion in the form of virtualized resources (i.e., virtual machines and containers), supercomputers’ resources are generally served through State-of-the-Art batch schedulers (e.g., SLURM, PBS, LSF, HTCondor). As such, the users submit their computational jobs to the system, which manages their execution with the support of queues. In this regard, predicting the behaviour of the jobs in the batch scheduler queues becomes worth it. Indeed, there are many cases where a deeper knowledge of the time experienced by a job in a queue (e.g., the submission of check-pointed jobs or the submission of jobs with execution dependencies) allows exploring more effective workflow orchestration policies. In this work, we focused on applying machine learning (ML) techniques to learn from the historical data collected from the queuing system of real supercomputers, aiming at predicting the time spent on a queue by a given job. Specifically, we applied both unsupervised learning (UL) and supervised learning (SL) techniques to define the most effective features for the prediction task and the actual prediction of the queue waiting time. For this purpose, two approaches have been explored: on one side, the prediction of ranges on jobs’ queuing times (classification approach) and, on the other side, the prediction of the waiting time at the minutes level (regression approach). Experimental results highlight the strong relationship between the SL models’ performances and the way the dataset is split. At the end of the prediction step, we present the uncertainty quantification approach, i.e., a tool to associate the predictions with reliability metrics, based on variance estimation.}

Despite the broad adoption of GPUs and other specialized architectures, the interest in spatial architectures like field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) has grown. While combining high performance, low power consumption and high adaptability constitute an advantage, these devices still suffer from a weak software ecosystem, which forces application developers to use tools requiring deep knowledge of the underlying system, often leaving legacy code (e.g., Fortran applications) unsupported. By realizing this, we describe a methodology for porting Fortran (legacy) code on modern FPGA architectures, with the target of preserving performance/power ratios. Aimed as an experience report, we considered an industrial computational fluid dynamics application to demonstrate that our methodology produces synthesizable OpenCL codes targeting Intel Arria10 and Stratix10 devices. Although performance gain is not far beyond that of the original CPU code (we obtained a relative speedup of                                                   \$\$\textbackslash times\$\$                                        \texttimes{}                                                                  ~0.59 and                                                   \$\$\textbackslash times\$\$                                        \texttimes{}                                                                  ~0.63, respectively, for a single optimized main kernel, while only on the Stratix10 we achieved                                                   \$\$\textbackslash times\$\$                                        \texttimes{}                                                                  ~2.56 by replicating the main optimized kernel 4 times), our results are quite encouraging to drawn the path for further investigations.

  abstract = {Graph embedding is a recurrent problem in quantum computing, for instance, quantum annealers need to solve a minor graph embedding in order to map a given Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem onto their internal connectivity pattern. This work presents a novel approach to constrained unit disk graph embedding, which is encountered when trying to solve combinatorial optimization problems in QUBO form, using quantum hardware based on neutral Rydberg atoms. The qubits, physically represented by the atoms, are excited to the Rydberg state through laser pulses. Whenever qubits pairs are closer together than the blockade radius, entanglement can be reached, thus preventing entangled qubits to be simultaneously in the excited state. Hence, the blockade radius determines the adjacency pattern among qubits, corresponding to a unit disk configuration. Although it is straightforward to compute the adjacency pattern given the qubits’ coordinates, identifying a feasible unit disk arrangement that matches the desired QUBO matrix is, on the other hand, a much harder task. In the context of quantum optimization, this issue translates into the physical placement of the qubits in the 2D/3D register to match the machine’s Ising-like Hamiltonian with the QUBO formulation of the optimization problems. The proposed solution exploits the power of neural networks to transform an initial embedding configuration, which does not match the quantum hardware requirements or does not account for the unit disk property, into a feasible embedding properly representing the target optimization problems. Experimental results show that this new approach overcomes in performance Gurobi solver.}

  abstract     = {As deep learning techniques become more and more popular, there is the need to move these applications from the data scientist’s Jupyter notebook to efficient and reliable enterprise solutions. Moreover, distributed training of deep learning models will happen more and more outside the well-known borders of cloud and HPC infrastructure and will move to edge and mobile platforms. Current techniques for distributed deep learning have drawbacks in both these scenarios, limiting their long-term applicability. After a critical review of the established techniques for Data Parallel training from both a distributed computing and deep learning perspective, a novel approach based on nearest-neighbour communications is presented in order to overcome some of the issues related to mainstream approaches, such as global communication patterns. Moreover, in order to validate the proposed strategy, the Flexible Asynchronous Scalable Training (FAST) framework is introduced, which allows to apply the nearest-neighbours communications approach to a deep learning framework of choice. Finally, a relevant use-case is deployed on a medium-scale infrastructure to demonstrate both the framework and the methodology presented. Training convergence and scalability results are presented and discussed in comparison to a baseline defined by using state-of-the-art distributed training tools provided by a well-known deep learning framework.},

  abstract     = {Many applications by design depend on costly trusted third-party auditors. One such example is the industrial application case of federated multi-disciplinary optimization (MDO), in which different organizations contribute to a complex engineering design effort. Although blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT) has strong potential in reducing the dependence on such intermediaries, the architectural complexity involved in designing a solution is daunting. In this paper, we analyze the architectural variants for decentralized private data sharing while guaranteeing auditability in terms of data access operations. Non-repudiation of actions taken by each party is a key requirement, as is availability of the shared data. % through storage governed by the chain. The architectural variants analyzed focus on attaining:~(i)~confidential data exchange, (ii)~maintaining and governing access to the shared data, (iii)~providing data access auditability, (iv)~data validation or conflict resolution, and to a lesser degree (v)~transaction and identity privacy. We systematically enumerate architectural decisions at the levels of:~storage, policy-based file access control, data encryption methods, and auditability mechanisms for private data. This analysis is based on extensive assessment of the state of the art on decentralized private data access management using static or dynamic policies, and private data validation without exposing confidential information. The main contribution of this work is a comprehensive overview of architectural variants for decentralized control of private, encrypted data, and the involved trade-offs in terms of performance, auditable trust and security. These findings are validated in the context on the aforementioned industry case that involves federated multi-disciplinary optimization (MDO).},

In the emerging area of spectral graph analysis, the computing often consists in a wavefront running over a tiled matrix, involving expensive linear algebra kernels. While these applications might benefit from parallel heterogeneous platforms (multi-core with GPUs),programming wavefront applications directly with high-performance linear algebra libraries yields code that is complex to write and optimize for the specific application. We advocate a methodology based on two abstractions (linear algebra and parallel pattern-based run-time), that allows to develop portable, self-configuring, and easy-to-profile code on hybrid platforms.},

However, there are still problems in data science and  engineering that involve algorithms with higher time complexity, like matrix  inversion or Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). This work presents the results of a survey that reviews a number of tools meant  to perform dense linear algebra at ``Big Data'' scale: namely, the proposed  approach aims first to define a feasibility boundary for the problem size of  shared-memory matrix factorizations, then to understand whether it is  convenient to employ specific tools meant to scale out such dense linear algebra  tasks on distributed platforms. The survey will eventually discuss the presented tools from the point of view of  domain experts (data scientist, engineers), hence focusing on the trade-off  between usability and performance.},

  abstract     = {Modern experimental achievements, with LHC results as a prominent but not exclusive representative, have undisclosed a new range of challenges concerning theoretical com- putations. Tree level QED calculation are no more satisfactory due to the very small experimental uncertainty of precision e+ e- measurements, so Next To Leading and Next to Next to Leading Order calculations are required. At the same time many-legs, high-order QCD processes needed to simulate LHC events are raising even more the bar of computational complexity. The drive for the present work has been the interest in calculating high multiplicity Higgs boson processes with a dedicated software library (RECOLA) currently under development at the University of Torino, as well as the related technological challenges. This thesis undertakes the task of exploring the possibilities offered by present and upcoming computing technologies in order to face these challenges properly. The first two chapters outlines the theoretical context and the available technologies. In chapter 3 a a case study is examined in full detail, in order to explore the suitability of different parallel computing solutions. In the chapter 4, some of those solutions are implemented in the context of the RECOLA library, allowing it to handle processes at a previously unexplored scale of complexity. Alongside, the potential of new, cost-effective parallel architectures is tested.},
