## [CLEAR-EO](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43108390/101182722)
**Horizon Europe  (2025 - ongoing)**  
CLEAR-EO leverages on newly available satellite data like Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) and EUMETSAT Polar System Second Generation (EPS SG), along with European Cloud infrastructures like the European Weather Cloud, to develop an analysis and geo-spatial notification system on top of a federated data space. These core components will support the development of innovative applications and services such as on-demand decision making workflows for 1) flash floods in urban areas, 2) short and long-term Climate Change impacts adaptation in agriculture, and 3) accurate air quality forecasts, with the final goal to contribute and enhance the Copernicus and the EO/weather services ecosystem.
CLEAR-EO teams up a multidisciplinary partnership from Research Organizations, weather forecasting centres, EO data and tech/cloud platform specialists to Group of Earth Observation (GEO)/Destination Earth (DestinE) contributors and SMEs to develop, demonstrate, and promote to relevant stakeholders and end-users new application developments and early exploitation of the new weather satellite data to support SDGs and the European Green Deal.

## SmartHPCQC
**ICSC Spoke 1 project**  
Development of resource scheduling and allocation strategies to allow integration of current NISQ quantum computers within HPC environments.

## [B-CRATOS](https://www.b-cratos.eu)
**H2020-EU - FET Open (2021 - ongoing)**  
Merging novel wireless communication, neuroscience, bionics, Artificial Intelligence and sensing to create for the first time a battery-free high-speed wireless in-body communication platform for Brain-Machine-Body connectivity.

## [ACROSS](https://www.acrossproject.eu)
**EuroHPC-02-2019 (2021 - ongoing)**  
The ACROSS project will co-design and develop an HPC, BD, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) convergent platform, supporting applications in the Aeronautics, Climate and Weather, and Energy domains.

## [Lexis](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/825532)
**H2020-ICT-11 (2021 - 2022)**  
LEXIS (Large-scale EXecution for Industry & Society) project will build an advanced engineering platform at the confluence of HPC, Cloud and Big Data which will leverage large-scale geographically-distributed resources from existing HPC infrastructure, employ Big Data analytics solutions and augment them with Cloud services.

## [Fortissimo 2](https://www.fortissimo-project.eu/)
**H2020-FoF project (2016 - 2018)**  
FF2 is a collaborative project that will enable European SMEs to be more competitive globally through the use of simulation services running on a High Performance Computing cloud infrastructure.

## [CloudFlow](http://www.eu-cloudflow.eu/)
**FP7-I4MS project (2016 - 2017)**  
Cloudflow will enable the remote use of computational services distributed on the cloud, seamlessly integrating these within established engineering design workflows and standards.

## [MACH](https://itea3.org/project/mach.html)
**ITEA2 project (2015 - 2016)**  
MAssive Calculations on Hybrid systems. The goal of the project is to develop a DSeL and a computation framework that allows to access hybrid hardware acceleration without specific expertise.

## [BoSS](https://www.imec-int.com/en/what-we-offer/research-portfolio/boss)
**IMEC-ICON project (2018 - 2019)**  
The BoSS project seeks to simplify the creation of legally-compliant, blockchain-secured applications that maintain confidentiality and privacy. To do so, the consortium will develop frameworks for technology selection, supporting middleware, and regulatory compliance.
Within the BoSS project, Noesis and KU Leuven demonstrated the potential of private blockchains to ensure audibility of data exchange for cross-company multidisciplinary optimization processes in aircraft design.

## [VaProFam](https://researchportal.be/en/project/value-driven-concept-design-mechatronic-product-families)
**FlandersMake-ICON project (2019 - 2021)**  
Value driven concept design for product families.

## [DC-CDS](https://researchportal.be/en/project/designer-centric-computational-design-synthesis)
**FlandersMake-ICON project (2019 - 2021)**  
Designer-centric computational design synthesis.
